Time Spent: <5-7 hours?> -> this was really hard in my opinion. I studied data structures on my previous class in Java, but even though the concept is very similar, the implementation is completely different. I fell like the lecture on this topic did not go deep enough to cover the extent of this assignment. I tried to find good examples on the book, and I was taken all the way to chapter 17. Thats not a chapter I have read. My main source was a book I have called "Objective Oriented Data Structures Using Java". This book has better, more detailed examples.

What learned: <Everything was a learning curve on this assignment. I learned that I shouldn't leave this type of assignments to last minute (its 5 am. I worked on this all night. God help me on the quiz because I am not sleeping today). I learned how the linked list works, kind of...but I don't fully understand, I do, but I don't. I have been confused about it since I was first exposed to it on my previous class. I will research and read more about it.>
 I apologize not adding a README file this time.
